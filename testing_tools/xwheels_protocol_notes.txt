First character is a packet type:

   Joystick seems to have these packet types:
     0x01 - init
     0x02 - motor command
     0x03 - shutdown

   ESC seems to have these packet types:
     0x81 - answer init
     0x82 - answer motor command
     0x83 - answer shutdown


Second character is the total packet length (including header and checksum)

     .... payload ...

Last character is the checksum


So:

  pkt[0] ==  Packet_type
  pkt[1] ==  total_packet_length
  pkt[2:-1] ==  ... actual data ...
  pkt[-1] == checksum



---------------------------
On a working, running ESC, when I'm sending 0x02 packets, the 0x82 answer packets
have a payload of 3 bytes.  Typically:

  0x00 0x00 0x04

Rasheed says the 3rd byte ("0x04" in this case) is the battery status.

If I unplug the right-side motor, both motors brake, and the return status becomes:

  0x03 0x00 0x04

If I do the same with the left-side motor, then the return status is:

  0x30 0x00 0x04

If I try to run a system with no motors attached, the 0x81 return status is:
  0x11 0x00 0x04

and the 0x82 return status is:
  0x33 0x00 0x04
