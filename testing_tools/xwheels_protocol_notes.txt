First character is a packet type:

   Joystick seems to have these packet types:
     0x01 - init
     0x02 - motor command
     0x03 - shutdown

   ESC seems to have these packet types:
     0x81 - answer init
     0x82 - answer motor command
     0x83 - answer shutdown


Second character is the total packet length (including header and checksum)

     .... payload ...

Last character is the checksum


So:

  pkt[0] ==  Packet_type
  pkt[1] ==  total_packet_length
  pkt[2:-1] ==  ... actual data ...
  pkt[-1] == checksum
